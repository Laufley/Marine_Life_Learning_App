These plastics cause lots of damage to an animal's insides, or they can die of starvation.

Ocean currents swirl the water around in a large circle and the plastic gets trapped. It covers an area that's 3 times the size of France, and contains at least 80,000 tons of plastic, which is the same weight as over 500 jumbo jets. You might think it looks like an island made of rubbish but it's actually more like a big soup of microplastics. Animals can eat these plastics thinking they are food and then die of starvation. There are big pieces of plastic too, though, and almost half of the 80,000 tons are fishing nets. Lots of animals get trapped in these nets and eventually die. In fact, at least 75% of the plastic in the GPGP comes from discarded fishing gear.",
        threats:"The patch is very far away from land, so no country wants to take responsibility for cleaning it up. Luckily, groups like The Ocean Cleanup are trying to help and are removing around 100 tons of plastic a year. To raise awareness, some people think the patch should be declared a country called 'The Trash Isles'. Would you want to live there?! The best way to stop the patch getting bigger, though, is to use less plastics in the first place.",
